# Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Algorithms for Pancreatic Cell Detection and Classification

The main goal for this project is to take a whole slide image of a pancreatic tissue section, segment each cell and then classify it into the correct cellular subtype. Generally, the pancreas can be broken up into endocrine, exocrine and vasculature. The endocrine can further be subdivided into the alpha, beta and delta cells whereas the exocrine can be further divided into acinar and ductal cells.
